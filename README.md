# SquareArea
Program counts areas of 10 squares

The program has a class named Square that contains fields for area and
the length of a side and whose constructor has a parameter
for the length of one side of a Square. The constructor
assigns its parameter to the length of the Square’s side field
and calls a private method that computes the area field. 
The program also includes read-only properties to get a Square’s side and area.
The main method creates an array of ten Square objects with sides that 
have values of 1 through 10. 
The program displays the values for each Square
